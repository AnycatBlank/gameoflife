# Conway's Game of Life

## Hosted at
The website is hosted on GitHub Pages at the following link-
https://anycatblank.github.io/gameoflife/

## How to control and test the Game
There are 3 input sections in the page

1) Conway's world generated randomly -
Changing the width and height in the text boxes will reactively change these width and height of the game matrix.
Every time the matrix dimension changes, a random initial state for the cells is calculated, and the world start animating itself by moving to the next generation.

2) Conway's world generated from seed -
You may provide a seed representing the initial state of the game's world. Please note that it expects the seed in the format presented in the examples below. Click on the Start with seed button to start animating the world.

```
Example of Seed -
1) Blinker - (a 5X5 matrix consisting of 0's and 1's, each row enclosed in square brackets)
[[00000][00100][00100][00100][00000]]

```
Please refer to the end of this README for more interesting seed inputs for the game.

3) Test Game
This section gives you a way to test out if the app follows the rules of the game correctly.
Please provide a number of iterations and an expected state in the same format as the seed provided above.
Click on the test_game button to see if the seed reached the expected state in the number of iterations provided.
You will see the test result at the top of the animating grid in the form of True or False.

## System requirements
Any browser that runs javascript. The input validation errors are presented as an alert pop-up. You might not see the input errors if your browser has pop-up blocker enabled.

The website has been tested with the latest version of chrome.
